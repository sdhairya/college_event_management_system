The robot that will complete the challenges in least time will bethe winner. Think your robot can overcome any obstacle-big or small in the least possible time.\n\nRobot Specifications:\n1) The maximum dimension of the robot can be 30 cm x 30cm x20 cm (l x b x h).\n2) The robot may be wired or wireless.\n3) The length of the wire (for wired bots) should be long enough to cover the whole track and wire should remain slack during the complete run.\n4) Maximum weight must not exceed 5 kg.\n5) The participants will be provided with 220 Volts, 50Hzstandard AC supply. Participants will have to themselves arrange for adaptor or batteries.\n6) The machine must not be made from Lego parts, or any ready-made kit, if we find such machine it will be disqualified. \n\nBATTERIES & POWER:\n1) The machine must be powered electrically only. Use of IC engine is not allowed. \n2) Batteries must be sealed, immobilized electrolyte type (gel cell, lithium, NiCad, or dry cells).\n3) The electric voltage anywhere in the machine should not be more then 12V DC at any point of time. \n\nGENERAL RULES:\n1) This is maze event so fastest and most balanced robot will win.\n2) Robot should be as per the given specifications.\n3) Each team can have maximum three members. Students from different institutes can form a team.\n4) Each member of the team must contain the identity card of his/her respected institute.\n5) The robot should not damage the arena. \n6) No test practice will be allowed on the arena. \n7) The robot must not leave behind any of its parts during the run; else it will result in disqualification \n8) Unethical behaviour could lead to disqualification. Faculty co-ordinators have all the rights to take final decision for any matter during the event. \n9) Judge's decision will be considered final. \n10) Certificates of Participation will be given to all the teams that will participate in the event, but not to the teams which get disqualified due to disobeying any of the competition rules. *Co–ordination committee reserves the right to add or update any rule before start of the event.\n\nTRACK SPECIFICATION:\n1) The track surface and course line may have unevenness. \n2) There will be certain obstacles in the race track which will try to slow down the robot.\n3) Arena will consist of mud, slippery surfaces, bumps etc.\n\nGAME RULES:\n1) The competition is based on time trail system.\n2) The top team from qualifying round makes it to the next round on basis of time trials. \n3) The game is divided into 3 rounds.\n\nROUND 1: Participants have to reach the centre of maze in minimum time by controlling the robot following the path given to them in chit. \n\nROUND 2: Participants have to follow the directions given to them in chit and reach the centre of the maze in order to burst the balloon. The balloon will also have another chit that consists of directions to come out of the maze which must be followed by the participants.\n\nROUND 3: Two robots of opposite teams will enter into the maze together from opposite side and have to bust the balloon which is at the centre of maze while following the directions given to them in the chit.\n\n3) Wires should remain slack during the course of the run. Pulling the wire to aid the robot in traversing may lead to disqualification.\n4) If any of the robots starts off before start up call, the counter would be restarted and the machines will get a second chance. If repeated again then team will be disqualified.\n5) Your robot must be ready when call is made for your team.\n6) Team members will be allowed only three times to touch or reset their robots position during the run. However, this will lead to a time penalty and timer will not stop during this course of action.\n7) Machine must not contain any readymade kits, pneumatic &hydraulic systems, IC engines.\n8) Decision about your robot will be taken by the organizers.\n9) No team will get a second chance after completing the track with poor score.",

A team gets 30 seconds to answer the question intended for it, and is awarded 20 points for answering it. If the team, the question intended for gives a wrong answer, the quiz master will give the correct answer. If the team that the question intended for passes it. The next team/s get 15 seconds to answer it and is awarded 10 points for the right answer. The team members can discuss before giving the answer. If a team cannot answer a question they can pass it or after 30 seconds it gets automatically passed to the next team. If a team is answering a question and the time passes, then the team gets to complete the answer and is awarded points for the right answer. There is no negative marking for wrong answer. No buzzer is used in this round\\nRapid Fire Round – \nEach team quota of 10 questions. In this round each team will be asked 10 questions one after another. On the immediate completion of a question, each team gets 5 seconds to answer it. If a team is not able to answer a question, they can pass it for the next question. There is no team discussion in this round. 10 points is awarded for the correct answer. No negative points for the wrong answer.
