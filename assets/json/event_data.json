Pulling the wire to aid the robot in traversing may lead to disqualification.\n4) If any of the robots starts off before start up call, the counter would be restarted and the machines will get a second chance. If repeated again then team will be disqualified.\n5) Your robot must be ready when call is made for your team.\n6) Team members will be allowed only three times to touch or reset their robots position during the run. However, this will lead to a time penalty and timer will not stop during this course of action.\n7) Machine must not contain any readymade kits, pneumatic &hydraulic systems, IC engines.\n8) Decision about your robot will be taken by the organizers.\n9) No team will get a second chance after completing the track with poor score."}

The steel structure is the assembly of different members like beams, and columns. These various steel members are interconnected using Rivets, Bolts, and Welding. This is known as a connection.\nConnections can be of various types, based on different criteria. Based on the fastening method, the connections are of three types: rivets, Bolts, and Welding. Based on rigidity, the connections are of three types-Rigid, Simple, and Semi-rigid.\nSteel's strength and resistance make it an exceptional material in terms of durability and economy. High impact and deformation resistance allow steel to be used in most large constructions as the main element of the supporting structure.\nWhen one hears about steel and connections, the human brain always shows tall structures and bridges. The challenge includes designing the Installation/ Model/Sculpture that must include steel joineries and connection with steel as a primary material. The specified material must be market readily available.\nThe proposed Installation/Model/Sculpture must not exceed the size limit of 10' x 10'x 10' (LxBxH) or 3000 mm x 3000 mm x 3000 mm (LxBxH) at an actual scale of 1:1.\nPlease refer to the SOR (Schedule Of Rates) provided in the registered email id.",
